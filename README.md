# qrd1114-24v-on-off-proximity-IR
Found this sensor qrt1114 IR sensor from youtube sensing in sumobots.-
This is a low range proximity sensor IR. Mostly used with analogue signal.-
I wondered if can make a small range on off proximity switch with it-
I made the sensor circuit in 2 parts. 
1)qrd1114 sensor to be put in tube.-
2)output module which processes the signal to 24v on/off

Sensor circuit 24v with led and 24v output.-
First test showed works as proximity switch range 7-9 mm.-
Detects nicely within the range.-
Tested it with relay 24v for the output side works nicely
Unwanted detection when flame is closeby, does not detect black objects.-
Probably because of range setting in comparator of 2.5V.-
